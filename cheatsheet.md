 # Comprehensive Math Notation and Programming Guide: From Basics to Advanced

## 1. Σ (Sigma) - Summation

### Basic Introduction
The Σ (Sigma) symbol represents summation in mathematics. It's used to describe the sum of a sequence of numbers.

### Simple Example
```
 5
 Σ i = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15
i=1
```
This means "sum up the values of i, where i goes from 1 to 5".

### Advanced Explanation
Summation is a fundamental operation in calculus and discrete mathematics. It can represent finite or infinite series and is crucial in areas like probability, statistics, and numerical analysis.

### Complex Example: Sum of Natural Numbers
**Mathematical Notation**: 
```
 n
 Σ i = n(n + 1) / 2
i=1
```

**Meaning**: The sum of integers from 1 to n.

**C Implementation**:
```c
int sum_of_natural_numbers(int n) {
    return n * (n + 1) / 2;
}
```

**Iterative Implementation**:
```c
int sum_of_natural_numbers_iterative(int n) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        sum += i;
    }
    return sum;
}
```

## 2. ∏ (Pi) - Product

### Basic Introduction
The ∏ (Pi) symbol represents the product of a sequence of numbers, similar to how Σ represents summation.

### Simple Example
```
 5
 ∏ i = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120
i=1
```
This means "multiply the values of i, where i goes from 1 to 5".
