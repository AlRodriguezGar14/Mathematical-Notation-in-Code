# Mathematical Notation in Code

## Overview

Welcome to the **Mathematical Notation in Code** repository! This project is a personal guide and exploration of integrating mathematical notation with programming. It is designed to aid in understanding and implementing mathematical concepts in code, particularly for those interested in how mathematical symbols and notations translate into practical programming scenarios.

## Important Note

**This project is not a professional educational tool.** It was created for personal learning and experimentation with mathematical notation and calculus. While the content aims to be accurate and useful, it is not guaranteed to be error-free or comprehensive. Use it at your own risk, and please verify any mathematical or coding implementations independently.

**Please note:** The current HTML is quite extensive and may appear unpolished. I plan to refactor and enhance it once the content reaches a satisfactory level of completeness and accuracy. This includes addressing any errors and ensuring that all examples are both correct and clearly presented.

## Contributions
